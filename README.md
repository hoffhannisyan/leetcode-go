# 🧩 LeetCode Solutions in Go

This repository contains my personal solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, implemented in **Go (Golang)**.

Each problem is a standalone function located in the `tasks/` directory.  
The `main.go` file shows commented example usages for each implemented task.
